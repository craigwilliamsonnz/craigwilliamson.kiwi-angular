<h2>My music journey</h2>
<p>Music has been a major part of my life right from when I was a kid.  My Poppa taught me the basics of pleying the paino and when I was 10 was able to get me cornet lessons with on the brass bands in Napier, the <a href="https://www.napiertechband.org" target="_blank">Napier Technical Memorial Band</a>.</p>
<p>Since then while I was living in Napier I've played with other groups including the Hawkes Bay Symphonic Band and the Hawkes Bay Jazz Club Big Band.</p>
<p>After moving to Christchurch I had a break while studying at Canterbury University.</p>
<p>After studying I joined the <a href="https://www.newbrightonsilverband.org.nz/" target="_blank">New Brighton Silver Band</a> in 2010.  Maybe it was divine but in 2011 I wound up conducting the band for 10 years.  I stepped down after the COVID19 pandemic to pass the baton on to a new generation.  I'm still playing with the band in the back row on the Eb Bass.  So next you go to a concert where the band is playing you will probably see me in the back row.</p>
<p>After stepping back from conducting I eventually picked up Mum's old 80-bass Excelsior accordion and started learning that.  So far I have been playing the accordion now for just over 12 months and have joined the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Canterbury-Accordion-Association-100081017510166/" target="_blank">Canterbury Accordion Association</a>'s learners group, the Bellowettes, and the Canterbury Accordion Orchestra on the Bass Accordion.  So you will see me around Christchurch playing the accordion as well now.</p>
<p>Not only that but I also play the piano at my local church, <a href="https://allsaintschch.org" target="_blank">All Saints Christchurch</a>.</p>
<p>So, if you are interested in learning brass, accordion or piano let me know.  I'm not a registered music teacher but I can give free lessons on accordion, brass, and piano to get you going.</p>
