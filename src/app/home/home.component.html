<h2 data-testid="home-content">Welcome to my personal website</h2>
<p>I started the website when everyone was in lock down during the COVID19 pandemic.  At the time I had never done much website development so I thought it would give me something to do.</p>
<p>When I first started it was using standard static HTML pages and over time I redeveloped it using a more advanced web framework.  So now it has become a test bed for my web development as I learn more about it.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I'm doing this is because I made a mistake when I was younger.  When the dotcom boom was in full swing in the early 2000s and everyone was rushing to create websites, I decided not to do that as everyone was going to go down that route and I wanted to take a different route.</p>
<p>BIG MISTAKE!</p>
<p>I don't regret the route I chose (software testing) but I looked at what people were doing with the amazing things that were coming out of development houses and I wanted to be able to do that as well.</p>
<p>So fast forward to now and when I'm not helping companies out with software testing I'm learning all about web frameworks and how everything fits together.</p>
<p>So this site is a labour of love for me to show what I can do if people want to have a website of their own or catch up on what I've been up to.  So take a look around and have a look.  The links below will take you to my social media pages (they're pretty boring honestly) and some of my personal software repositories.</p>
